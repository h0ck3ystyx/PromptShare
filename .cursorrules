rules:
  - Use snake_case for variable and function names.
  - All files in src/ and tests/ must have __init__.py.
  - Public functions and classes require proper docstrings (PEP 257) and type annotations.
  - Always lint code using ruff and format before commit.
  - Organize FastAPI (or Flask) apps in modules: routers, models, services, constants.
  - All API endpoints use typed Pydantic models; include a summary docstring for docs.
  - Use dependency injection for resources and avoid globals.
  - All environment configuration via env variables only.
  - Require unit tests for each logic module; use pytest and keep >85% coverage.
  - Document complex code and prompt AI to add clarifying comments where needed.
  - No secrets in code—use secure env or vault integration.
  - Review and upvote effective Cursor rules in team meetings.[web:43][web:47][web:49][web:59]
